- let the file be renamed when uploading
- add tags to the file when uploading
- don't insert into the database if the upload fails or have a way to handle it
- have a way to edit parent/child tags of a tag and view it more intuitavely
- let the color hex be directly entered when editing/creating tags
- fix formatting with light/dark mode for "root" badges and color select preview
- show all files on the file page and have a search by tags that includes all child tags in the search as well
- maybe just completely ignore hierarchy for initial version
